## N-Layer Project Skeleton for .Net Core

This repository serves as a foundational backbone for starter projects, designed to streamline the development process by incorporating essential architectural patterns and practices. It aims to provide a structured approach to building scalable and maintainable applications.

### Features

#### Repository Pattern

- **Purpose**: The Repository pattern plays a crucial role in mediating between the domain and data mapping layers. It acts like an in-memory collection of domain objects, providing a more object-oriented view of the persistence layer.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Abstraction**: It abstracts the details of data access mechanisms.
  - **Decoupling**: Helps in decoupling the application from specific data sources.
  - **Testability**: Enhances testability through the use of interfaces.

#### Unit Of Work Pattern

- **Purpose**: The Unit of Work pattern is instrumental in maintaining a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes and the resolution of concurrency problems.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Transaction Management**: Manages transactions in a more organized manner.
  - **Change Tracking**: Keeps track of changes within a transaction to ensure consistency.
  - **Concurrency**: Helps in solving concurrency problems when multiple transactions are trying to modify the same data.

#### Dependency Injection (DI)

- **Purpose**: Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique that removes the responsibility of direct creation and management of the lifespan of other object instances upon which our class of interest (consumer class) is dependent.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Flexibility**: Makes the system more flexible by decoupling classes.
  - **Reusability**: Increases the reusability of classes.
  - **Testability**: Improves testability by allowing dependencies to be replaced with mocks or stubs.

### Getting Started
